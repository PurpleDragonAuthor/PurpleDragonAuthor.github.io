This one came out of the cafés of Paris, the bullrings of Pamplona, and the hollow spaces left by war. Jake Barnes and his friends - artists, drunks, lovers - drift across Europe in search of something solid. They find fiestas, fights, and brief flashes of honesty. It’s about how people survive without knowing why, and about what it means to be a man when the war has already taken your manhood.
