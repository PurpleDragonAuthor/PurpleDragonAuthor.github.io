This one came out of the mountains. Spain, 1937. I’d been there, seen the war up close. Not the kind you win. The kind that breaks countries and people and leaves the rest to pick through the ruins. Robert Jordan is an American who blows bridges. He has three days. That’s all. Three days to live, love, doubt, and decide what he’ll die for.
