An old fisherman goes out to sea and hooks the greatest catch of his life - a giant marlin. What follows is a struggle not just between man and beast, but between purpose and futility, dignity and defeat. The ocean doesn't lie, and neither does age. This is a story of a man alone, doing the one thing he knows how to do, one last time.
