The goblin girl was never meant to be a hero. But when the witch who raised her falls under a terrible curse, Grizz is the only one who can break it.

She's prepared for monsters, magic and mayhem. What she isn't prepared for is the mage who refuses to let her go alone. Together, they must battle through twisted ruins, face creatures of shadows and thorns, and unravel the dark magic binding an undead king to the land.

With time running out, can Grizz and Silas stop a centuries-old curse before it's too late?

Perfect for fans of fantasy, adventure and slow-burn romance, The Witch's Garden is a spellbinding tale of courage, friendship and finding where you truly belong.
