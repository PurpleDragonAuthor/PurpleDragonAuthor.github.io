I served in the First World War, and I remember it not for glory but for mud, rain, and death. *A Farewell to Arms* tells the story of Frederic Henry, an American ambulance driver who falls in love with a British nurse, Catherine Barkley. Their romance is brief, brutal, and doomed - like war itself. It’s not a love story. It’s a story with love in it, surrounded by all the things that try to kill it.
