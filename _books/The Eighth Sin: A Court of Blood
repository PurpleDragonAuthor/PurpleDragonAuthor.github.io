TWhen the aging demon emperor gives his children an ultimatum, Prince Valdir launches a brutal campaign to claim the crown. At his side if the war hero known as the Sword of Nour; Cliona Sangaria.

Together, they wage war across the realms in the name of conquest and glory. But with every victory, the cost grows higher - and Cliona begins to see the true price of Valdir's ambition.

Torn between honour and conscience, and haunted by a past she cannot forget, Cliona must decide where her loyalty lies - because in a world ruled by power and blood, loyalty can become the deadliest sin of all.


A Court of Blood is the second installment in The Eighth Sin, a dark fantasy series filled with war, sacrifice and the corruption of power. For readers who want to experience the story chronologically, this installment can also be read first.
