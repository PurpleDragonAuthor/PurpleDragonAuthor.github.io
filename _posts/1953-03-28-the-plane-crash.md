They thought I was dead. The papers said so. Twice.

We were flying over the Nile in a little plane, looking for elephants. Something went wrong - wires, wings, God knows. We came down hard. Then the rescue plane caught fire the next day. I carried a bottle of gin out of the wreckage and my wife’s purse. Everything else burned.

I remember thinking, this is how it ends. Not with a story or a bullet or a bull, but a broken body in the grass, far from the sea. But it didn’t end.

You live through something like that and your bones feel heavier afterward. But your sentences get leaner. You stop wasting time.
