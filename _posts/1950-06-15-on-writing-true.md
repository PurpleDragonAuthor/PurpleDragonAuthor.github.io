There is only one thing to do when you write. You tell the truth. Not the fancy truth or the clever truth or what someone wants to hear. Just the truth the way you saw it and felt it. If you can’t do that, it’s all decoration.

I used to write one true sentence every morning to start. One that made everything else feel real. If I could get that, I could go on. If not, I would go for a walk. Or box. Or drink. Sometimes all three.

Writing is not about being smart. It is about being brave. You sit down. You remember. You bleed a little. You make it plain.
