The sea is never lonely. A man can be. The sea only is.

When I was younger, I thought noise would keep the loneliness out - bars, women, war. But noise runs out. The sea doesn’t. You sit alone in a boat, and it talks to you in ways no person can. It doesn’t care who you are. That’s the gift.

There are days when writing feels like that. You sit down alone. You try to haul something up from the deep. Sometimes it’s a sentence. Sometimes it’s just silence. You keep going either way.
