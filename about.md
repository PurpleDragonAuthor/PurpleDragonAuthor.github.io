    <p>I was born in Oak Park, Illinois, in 1899, a town of broad lawns and narrow minds. I learned early to listen more than I spoke, to write what I knew, and to cut the fat off every sentence. I never wrote to please people. I wrote to tell the truth the best I could.</p>

    <p>I served as an ambulance driver in the Great War, lived in Paris among the lost generation, and found stories in bullfights, bars, battlefields, and boats. I fished the Gulf Stream, ran with the bulls in Pamplona, and hunted lions in East Africa. I wrote about all of it, but never everything.</p>

    <p>The novels came like storms - among them <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>, <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>, <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>, and <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>. I wrote them in cafes and cabins, longhand, typewriter, whiskey nearby. People say my style is simple. It isn't. Itâ€™s honest. And it cost me.</p>

    <p>If you're here, you're looking for something - maybe the same things I looked for: grace under pressure, beauty in pain, a sentence true enough to stand on its own. If you find it, write it down.</p>
